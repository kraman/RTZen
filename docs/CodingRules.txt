This document contains an outline of the Coding Rule that have to be
followed while developing Zen code.


Code Formatting
-----------------

The code should be formatted according to the following style rules:

    - Indentation should be 4 spaces (DON'T USE TAB or expand TAB as SPACE)

    - Class Names should be Capitalized, and should be meaningful

      For example

       Button, Frame, EventHandler, Acceptor, etc  [GOOD]

       Event_Handler, eventHandler, event_handler  [BAD]

      NEVER EVER PUT "_" IN A CLASS NAME!!!

    - Packages name should be all small caps:

       edu.uci.ece.zen, java.lang, org.jacorb.poa  [GOOD]

       MY.PACKAGE.rocks, org.COOLpakage.Magic      [BAD]


    - Place particular attention to the access visibility that you give to
