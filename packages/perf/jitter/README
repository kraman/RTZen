Roundtrip Latency Measurements for different ORB implementations

This package implements the tests for RTZen and for TAO. A package with the 
same name exists in regular Zen, which implements the according test on 
regular Zen. 

This package uses the package perf.TimeStamp, which implements a native 
time stamp driver. The TimeStamp driver was taken from Ed Pla, it uses
unix commands to get an accurate (more granular than 1ms) time stamp.

During the test each individual call is measured, this allows jitter 
calculations later on. 


1) Run the tests
Use the script run_tests for executing each part of the test and generating
the result files. The local tests can be run on any node.

Run a local measurement test for RTZen on TimeSys:
 ./run_tests both 2 2 

Run a local measurement test for TAO:
 ./run_tests both 3 3 

To run a test with regular Zen, change to the directory of the perf.jitter
package WITHIN regular Zen and execute:
 ./run_tests both 1 1 

Copy the result files of the regular Zen named timeRecords.1.*.txt back to 
the RTZen perf/jitter direcory for generating the graphs.


For running the remote tests ssh has to be installed. Currently run_test is 
setup to execute the remote part on node0.rtzen.pces.emulab.net. Modify the 
script for a different hostname. Run the scripts as shown above but append a 
zero '0' to the second argument (e.g. ./run_test both 20 2).


2) Generating Graphs
Generating the graphs uses octave and gnuplot. Perform the following command
to generate the graphs:

  octave <scriptName>


The following scripts are available

gen_tput.m  generates 4 graphs with for latency/throughput local/remote 
            comparing each implementation
get_summary.m  gives the raw statistical data for all tests. output into text 
	           file

gen_jitter.m  generates 6 graphs one for each implementation/location. 
              Showing the jitter over increasing size.

gen_local.m   compares the jitter for a fixed length over the different
              implementation for local calls. ATTENTION this one is 
              written for Matlab.

gen_remote.m  compares the jitter for a fixed length over the different
              implementation for remote calls. ATTENTION this one is 
              written for Matlab.
