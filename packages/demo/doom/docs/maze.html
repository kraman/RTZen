If you're a novice, I would recommend you do not<br>tackle this code - it's poorly documented, and a perfect example of how<br>not to write modular, reusable code.<br><br>If you're still not sure what java maze is, see my homepage for a demo:<br><br>  http://www.geocities.com/jht2k/<br><br>What do I need to compile and run java maze?<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>this archive is missing a load of data files. You'll need 64x64 texture<br>files in .gif format for the walls, floors and objects. Also, a 256x256<br>greyscale bitmap in .gif format for the lightmap. Plasma clouds look<br>great for the lightmap.<br><br>Also, java maze is an applet. This means you'll need a .html file to<br>run enable it to run within a web browser. Those of you proficient in<br>java programming should have no problem with this.<br><br>Known bugs/issues<br>-----------------<br><br>There are a number of issues with the code in its current form. I'd be<br>flattered if somebody had the time and dedication to fix these problems.<br><br>- Odd crashes when standing close to walls. This is -something- to do with<br>  the optimization of the floor drawing.<br>- Clipping of the floor and ceiling is not completed. This shows itself<br>  worst when you walk towards the corners of the map.<br>- Object support is minimal. Also objects are not depth sorted.<br>- No collision detection with walls. If the amount of mail I've recieved<br>  about java maze is anything to go by, this is -by far- the most<br>  important bug in the world... ever!<br>- The renderer draws walls on the right hand side of the applet a slightly<br>  different shade to walls on the left hand side.<br>- Walls are supposed to be lit at the same level as the floor tile they<br>  face - the implementation of this is not quite right.<br><br>Future additions<br>----------------<br><br>As for future feature additions go, I can think of the following. By the<br>way, my work on java maze is done - I'm relying on others to<br>implement these features:<br><br>- Support for 16 and 24bit colour modes.<br>- Trilinear (sort of) mip-mapping on the walls and floor. I don't like<br>  the artifacts you see on distant walls and floor.<br>- Coloured lighting. This would look awesome. You'd probably need three<br>  different lightmaps for RGB.<br>- IP networking support for Internet play.<br>- Intelligent enemies for a singleplayer game.<br>- Polygon objects, such as barrels and lamps. Also sliding doors,<br>  portcullises (portculli?). Anyone remember "Into the Shadows" ??<br>- Sky texture that shows through parts of the map without a ceiling. I<br>  tried this once, but I couldn't get a decent framerate. <br>- Dynamic lighting effects (from fireballs, guns, flickering lamps etc).<br>  This can't be that difficult given that the engine already reacts in<br>  realtime to changes in the lightmap.<br>- A map editor facility, to create/save/load maps.<br>- Lightmap generator (probably some kind of raytracer) to create a<br>  realistic lightmap from a list of light sources.<br><br>And finally ...<br><br>- Optimize! Experiment with several different algorithms and squeeze<br>  every single ounce of performance out of the JVM! java maze is one<br>  of the few java graphical applets with a reasonable framerate - I'd<br>  like it to stay that way.<br><br></pre>
