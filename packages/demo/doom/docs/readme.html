<h1>CORBA DOOM</h1>
This code is a demonstration of 3D multiplayer gaming using CORBA. It
began life as a <a
 href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/z/Xiaotong.Zhuang/doomreport.pdf">research
project</a> by <a
 href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/z/Xiaotong.Zhuang/">Xiaotong
Zhuang</a>. Although he has lost the original source code, he gave me
permission to decompile the project and release it as open-source. I
used the <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/neshkov/dj.html">DJ
Java Decompiler</a> by Atanas Neshkov for this task.<br>
<br>
Note that this game is not really a game. Players can walk around a
maze and see each other, but that's about it. They cannot shoot each
other or do anything else. This was a limitation of the original code,
and I simply ported it from RMI to CORBA. It is intended to be used
simply as a demo of what is possible with CORBA.<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
To compile the code, run "ant".<br>
<br>
To play the game, first start the server by running "ant server". You
can then launch clients on the same machine or on other machines by
running "ant client".<br>
<h2>Notes<br>
</h2>
Because it has been decompiled, the code is not very clean. All of the
comments have been stripped, and local variables and parameters have
been given dummy names. Still, it is fairly readable and can be
modified and redistributed under the terms of the GNU GPL license.<br>
<br>
By the way, "Doom" is a misnomer. This application has much more in
common with Doom's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D, than with Doom.<br>
