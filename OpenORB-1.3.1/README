  What is it?
  -----------

  OpenORB is a fully compliant implementation of the OMG CORBA/IIOP
  specification. It provides a lot of features, services and
  extensions.


  Build
  -----

  To build OpenORB from scratch you need the source code via anonymous
  access from the CVS repository on openorb.sf.net.

  Note, that all packages refer to a "tools" module which holds the
  libraries that are shared by all packages. To compile OpenORB you
  need this "tools" package in parallel to your OpenORB directory.

  Therefore the usual CVS command sequence for OpenORB is:

  cvs co tools
  cvs co OpenORB

  When you have both modules checked out, type the following to
  build the jars of the OpenORB package from the sources:

  cd OpenORB
  ./build.sh jar-all (under UNIX)  or  build jar-all (under Windows)

  When the build process succeeds the dist directory contains the
  jars, in the case for OpenORB there are openorb-x.y.z.jar and
  openorb_tools-x.y.z.jar where "x.y.z" is the current version number
  of the package. The first jar file contains all the classes that are
  needed for running a CORBA application, the second jar file contains
  the IDL compiler which is used to create the stub and the skeleton
  for a CORBA object.

  Note: The standard build setup assumes that the Java Runtime 
  Libraries are located in ${java.home}/lib/rt.jar. If your JDK doesn't
  use this path then you must specify the jdk-runtime-library property
  in the local.properties file.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the SourceForge
  Project web site <http://openorb.sf.net/>.


  Documentation
  -------------

  Documentation is available in XML format, in the src/doc/ directory.
  To build the documentation from the sources please type:

  ./build.sh doc (under UNIX)  or  build doc (under Windows)

  When the build process succeeds the dist directory contains a pdf
  and an html file which have been generated from the xml file.

  Information concerning OMG Standard Minor Codes is available at
  the following URL: http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?minor-codes
